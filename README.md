## Summary

This is my 7th FEND Project. The task was to use the react framework to create a responsive bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Installation

To get started clone this repo to your computer or download the zip and extract it somewhere. Inside the Project folder do the following:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Features

In this application you can sort and categorize books in different "shelves" The three shelves are:

Currently Reading
Want to Read
Read

You can controle which books belong to which shelf by using the dropdown menu each book has. You can also remove the book complety from the shelves. If you want you can search for new Books using the search function and add them to one of the shelves.
